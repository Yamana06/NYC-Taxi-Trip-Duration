Exploratory Data Analysis on NYC Taxi Trip Duration Dataset

Taxi is one of the urban public transports in many busy countries. Unlike other public transports, taxi rides provide accessibility, convenience, yet privacy to passengers. A competitive and reasonable taxi pricing is worth the 
ride for private car users to switch to a taxi service. Millions of taxi trips data 
are generated on monthly basis, which this data can be useful to gain the 
insight of the traffic patterns and obtain a clear view of urban city life. Not 
only that, by leveraging the given dataset, taxi demand on major events like 
Christmas and New Year’s Eve, can be studied in order to make a better 
decision making.

In this project, I examine the urban dataset of New York City taxi trips. 
According to taxi factbook report release by NYC Taxi & Limousine 
Commission (2018), TLC taxi trips in New York City has a total of over 41 
million trips a year between June 2017 and June 2018. In general, taxi trips 
comprise spatial elements like longitude and latitude points. Thus, this data 
enables to encode geolocation information into an insight of urban traffic 
movement and activities. 
Not only that, other attributes like taxi Id, number of passengers are also 
recorded which allows to study the traffic congestion, optimal fleet size. 

Data is obtained through Kaggle repository titled “NYC Taxi Trip Duration” 
which the data composes of taxi ride in New York City from 2009 to 2015. 
The dataset attributes including key, pickup and drop-off geolocation, date, 
time, passenger count and finally fare amount will be analysed.
